title: "Using reticulate's Python Engine with knitr"
---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
knitr::knit_engines$set(python = eng_python)
knitr::cache_engines$set(python = cache_eng_python)
```

Cache can handle changes to second chunk:

```{python}
x = 1
```

```{python}
print(x + 1)
```
